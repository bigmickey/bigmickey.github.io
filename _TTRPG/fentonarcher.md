A new face in the Silver Pearl Inn of Crab Cove approaches you and politely asks to share your table and break bread with you for the evening.  He introduces himself as Fenton Archer and after tankard of ale he is enjoying your company and regaling you of his recent adventures.  He is recently returned from Good Wood where he had been trapping silver foxes and river beaver for their pelts when he had the misfortune to run into one of the wilding tribes that inhabit the woods. Their leader, a surprisingly thick set half-elf identifying herself as Everglade the Lucky demanded a tax in return for Fenton's safe passage through their territory. Fenton considers himself luck that he managed to escape the encounter losing only the pelts he had collected and a crossbow with 20 bolts. Evidently living in the woods limits the wildling tribes' access to the clever machinery available in more civilized parts.

Just arrived in Crab Cove, Fenton thinks he might have more success as a trapper in the northern forests of Dragons Neck Island and plans to venture there soon. He is keen to hear all you have to tell about Crab Cove, Dragon's Neck Island and the folks who live there ...
