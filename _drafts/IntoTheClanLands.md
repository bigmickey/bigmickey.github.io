Dwayne Rock is sorry to see you leave Crab Cove or at least he will miss your custom. He tells you to be careful in the woods that lie to the north and to stick to the well-trodden paths. His parting advice is not to trust any of the clans should you encounter them!

After a tiring day's hike you make camp a little ways off the path you have been following. The woods are dark and full of unnerving sounds so you are happy when a familiar face makes an appearance by your camp fire - it seems Fenton Archer has been exploring the woods too.

Fenton has been working in the woods for a few days trapping for furs and pelts. He excitedly shows you his haul. When he hears you are venturing into the Clans Lands he asks if he can join you as he thinks he can trade profitably among the clans people. Let Fenton join you?

Fenton is glad to have your company too. Over a simple supper of boiled root vegetables he tells you about the wildlife in the woods - mainly foxes, badgers and hares but there is something much larger and stronger in the vicinity which was able to destroy some of his traps.

The night passes peacefully enough and you set off together in the morning. It is mid-afternoon when a woman's voice reaches you shouting "Who is top dog here?" You see her standing 100 yards away carrying a loaded crossbow and holding the leashes of three growling war dogs ..

You recognize the top dog question as a common challenge in the clans lands. The answer will be one of the clans from Dragon's Neck - Bearclaws, Warrers or Hensmen. Answering the wrong clan is top dog is likely to anger your interrogator and her dogs already look angry!

You know that the clans are famous for different cultures. Bearclaws for craftsmanship, Warrers for their skill in combat and Hensmen for their abilities in animal husbandry. This lady certainly seems to have her war dogs well trained. Which clan do you say is top dog?
