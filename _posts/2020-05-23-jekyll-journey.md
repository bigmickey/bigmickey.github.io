I haven't looked at this site for a few months but I have lots I want to blog about so I decided to revisit.

I have chosen jekyll to help build and maintain my static blogging website and I am still more or less right at the beginning.

I managed to clone my github repository for my github pages website onto my local machine and from here, after wrestling with the machine to install and recognise the latest versions of ruby, rvm and jekyll, I realise I can run 

   jekyll serve

to create a local webserver which serves my pages.  This is the ideal mechanism for experimenting locally before pushing my pages back to github.  Just a small step perhaps, but this blog post is my first step in testing this workflow - so if you are reading this, it worked!!
