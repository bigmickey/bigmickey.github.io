So far, so good.  However I need a different menu layout for my blog posts.  Rather than all posts appearing under the 'Blog' menu item, I want to have a sub-menu with entries like Journal (where a post like this would go) and other headings for articles related to topics that interest me like Travel, Coding, Crypto, TTRPG and Miscellaneous.

So today I am trying to figure out how to do that ... stay tuned.
