So far, so good.  However I need a different menu layout for my blog posts.  Rather than all posts appearing under the 'Blog' menu item, I want to have a sub-menu with entries like Journal (where a post like this would go) and other headings for articles related to topics that interest me like Travel, Coding, Crypto, TTRPG and Miscellaneous.

So today I am trying to figure out how to do that ... stay tuned.

Well, this isn't quite what I was shooting for but it seems more involved than I anticipated. I've learned that categories are a thing in Jekyll.  This post has a category of 'Journal' which is what makes it now appear under a sub-heading of 'Journal'.  What I really wanted was a page showing all the categories which link to the blog posts for that each category.  This will have to do for now but I'm still working on it :)
