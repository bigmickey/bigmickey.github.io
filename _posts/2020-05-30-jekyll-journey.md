I found this excellent article https://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/ 

In summary, the author explains that Jekyll natively expects two kinds of elements - posts and articles.  Posts are essentially blog posts dated and listed in reverse chronological order.  In other words exactly what I added to category Journal in my last update.

Pages are things like the default About page which do not have a natural relationship with each other.

The author then introduces collections which are essentially pages that DO have a relationship with each other.  These sound perfect for what I am trying to achieve so I am going to try adding one or more collections to my site today.

Can you tell if I was successful?
