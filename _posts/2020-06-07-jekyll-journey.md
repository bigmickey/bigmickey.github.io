I am learning a bit more about how Jekyll works.  I'm watching the tutorial videos from the jekyll site like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxua_1vyFck&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&index=4) on basic site generation.

The original guide I used to create the first version of this site was [this article](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

While I am grateful to Jonathan McGlone for writing that eminently understandable introduction, I think I am beginning to get a glimmer that Jekyll has moved on quite a bit since the article was written.  Almost all of the original files and directories were created by hand but now I seem to be missing quite a lot of stuff that is automatically generated when creating a Jekyll site from scratch using jekyll new <sitename>.

I am currently messing around with a newly generated site to see what the differences are. My next challenge will be figuring out how to bring this site up to speed with all the new Jekyll content and structures.  Wish me luck!

(I also just learned how to do links in Jekyll - enclose text in square brackets immediately followed by link in regular brackets)
