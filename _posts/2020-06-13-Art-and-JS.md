Something a bit different in the last few days. I bought a Wacom One to learn more about digital drawing and art. I had planned to use it with Gimp. It works in that I can use the pen to move the cursor around and so on but I cannot get the Wacom One to show up in Gimp's list of Input Devices. Accordingly it is of limited value. Not want to splurge on Photoshop licenses I downloaded InkScape which seems to work pretty well with the tablet. Now I need to learn how to insert images in Jekyll so that I can share some of my efforts.

I'm also planning to take another look at Javascript for a few ideas I have.
