Being learning a bit more about Inkscape today which I am enjoying. Learned that SVG graphics have 'nodes' and 'handles' that define the shape of an object. After free-hand drawing you can use these to tweak the shape in various ways. Now trying to decide if this will be a better approach than simply trying to draw completely free-hand with the calligraphy tool.

Did a little bit more research on Javascript too. I want to scrape some data from another webpage but it turns out that running in a browser expressly prohibits that kind of bahaviour so back to the drawing board. Maybe node.js?
