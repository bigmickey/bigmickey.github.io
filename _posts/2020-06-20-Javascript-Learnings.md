I have been delving a bit deeper into Javascript on Node. I would like to pull the Bitcoin price from cryptowat.ch simply to calculate current value of a given number of bitcoins. I have been using Cheerio to parse the result returned from Request and finally am able to grab all the links from cryptowat.ch's page and print the title of each. The link containing the Bitcoin price has a title of Bitcoin so I should be close to being able to grab it.

Once I figure out how to link articles in Jekyll, I will add an article on how I am doing this!
