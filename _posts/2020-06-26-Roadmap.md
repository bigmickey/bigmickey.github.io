When I say 'Roadmap' what I really mean is trying to put some order around my own to-do list! Currently top-of-mind is expanding the Javascript screen-scaping to display a page that aggregates all my assets (crypto, shares, pensions, ..) and gives me a realtime total value. However I also want to have an ecommerce site so that means learning how to take payments online. That could be btcpay server in the first instance but I also want to look at fiat currencies using Stripe. And in all cases, do these integrate with Jekyll on github pages? Will I finally need to pay for my own domain and hosting??

Lots of exciting questions to answer and experiments to perform :D
