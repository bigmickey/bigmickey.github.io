Finally I have managed to figure out how to get my non-posts to appear on my Jekyll / Github Pages website. I am using collections which is an easy way to get Jekyll to generate your non-post pages under _site but the trick to getting them to appear is to add some logic in Liquid to your layouts to explicitly create links to those pages.

Now that I have the basics it is time to think a bit harder about the site design itself ...
