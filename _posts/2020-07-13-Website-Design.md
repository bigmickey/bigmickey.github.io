Finally I have managed to figure out how to get my non-posts to appear on my Jekyll / Github Pages website. I am using collections which is an easy way to get Jekyll to generate your non-post pages under _site but the trick to getting them to appear is to add some logic in Liquid to your layouts to explicitly create links to those pages.

Now that I have the basics it is time to think a bit harder about the site design itself ... and here is the very rough outline of what I'd like in the first instance:

![Rough Website Design]({{site.url}}/assets/images/websitedesign.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

As it happens, the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme Collections example looks very similar:

![Minimal Designs Collections Example]({{site.url}}/assets/images/MinimalMistakesCollectionsPage.png){:class="img-responsive"}

[Here's the link](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/collection-archive/). Now I just need to figure out how that's done :)
