I once read a post (on Hackers News I think) that the ability to take money online IS your startup. I am sure this was before Stripe had appeared but the point still stands - how will your website or mobile app make money if you can't accept payment?

With this in mind, even though I don't yet even have a product to sell, I'm going to attempt to integrate Stripe into my Github Pages website.

A quick search yielded [this handy-looking guide](https://github.com/stripe-samples/github-pages-stripe-checkout). I will let you know how I get on.
