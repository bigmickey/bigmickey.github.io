Some personal news today - it is the first day of the rest of my life when I do not have to show up for work for someone else! It feels great but equally I am faced with a question - what now? I have had a whole career to think about this moment and what I would do with my time so I have some reasonably well developed thoughts. In a nutshell, I want to be an indie-hacker.

That's fine as far as it goes but what will I build? I know it will be something online but beyond that I have loads of ideas but not much direction. Nevertheless, whatever I end up with, I know there will be some commonality regardless of the specific concept so I wanted to lay out some of these as I can usefully work on them before making any commitment to one idea. So here they are:

 - Design
 - Javascript (especially related to design)
 - Networking
 - Marketing
 - Sales
 - Accepting payments online
 - Writing

These are in no particular order and I will likely jump around among them but that's OK and hopefully will keep me interested.

You can expect more regular updates on this site too!
